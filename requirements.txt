# RNN Scratch Assignment Requirements
# Compatible with Python 3.7.x and higher
# Only minimal libraries used as specified in assignment

numpy>=1.18.0  # Compatible with Python 3.7.x
matplotlib>=3.1.0  # For visualization (optional)

# NOTE: The assignment specifically requires implementation using only
# minimal libraries such as NumPy. Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch 
# versions listed in assignment are environment compatibility
# requirements, not implementation requirements.

# Environment compatibility (for reference only - NOT used in implementation):
# Python 3.7.x, Keras 2.2.x, TensorFlow 1.14.x/2.0, PyTorch 1.2.x
